# Server Sync 

Scripts used to automate the backup process of the files from my local machine to the home server.

This README will be extended in the future and will describe in details functions as well as the process of setting up the variables and crontab.  

Everything was developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04(client) and Ubuntu 16.04.(server).
